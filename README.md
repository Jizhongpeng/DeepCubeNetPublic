Reconstruction of CS Hyperspectral Images using deep learning

DeepCubeNet is a deep learning architecture for reconstruction of Compressive sensed Hyperspectral images.

Usage:
Install required libraries using pip install and the requirement file.
Run predict.py to predict the test files in the input.

Other results are shown in our paper ' DeepCubeNet: Reconstruction of spectrally compressive sensed hyperspectral images with deep neural networks'.
